This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL to derive meaningful business insights.

The dataset represents a fictional coffee business and includes information about customers, products, cities, and sales transactions.



The objective of this project is to demonstrate SQL querying skills, including joins, aggregations, filtering, and business-driven analysis.



**Business Objectives**



Analyze overall sales performance

Identify top-selling products

Understand customer distribution across cities

Measure revenue contribution by product and location

Practice real-world SQL query scenarios
